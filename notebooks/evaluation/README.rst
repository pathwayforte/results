Evaluation
==========
This folder contains three notebooks plotting the results stored in 
https://github.com/pathwayforte/results/tree/master/input.

Predictive modeling tasks
-------------------------
Statistical analysis of the model metrics for the three tasks conducted in this paper.

- `Tumor vs. Normal Prediction <https://github.com/pathwayforte/results/blob/master/notebooks/evaluation/Plot%20Evaluation%20of%20Tumor%20vs.%20Normal%20Prediction.ipynb>`_
- `Subtype Classification <https://github.com/pathwayforte/results/blob/master/notebooks/evaluation/Plot%20Evaluation%20of%20Subtype%20Classification.ipynb>`_
- `Survival Analysis <https://github.com/pathwayforte/results/blob/master/notebooks/evaluation/Plot%20Evaluation%20of%20Survival%20Analysis.ipynb>`_

Pathway enrichment tasks
------------------------

1. `Analogues comparison <https://github.com/pathwayforte/results/blob/master/notebooks/evaluation/analogues_comparison>`_.
Comparison of functional enrichment tasks restricted to equivalent pathways across databases. This exercise was
conducted to enable the comparison of the *p*-values in the results (due to the large differences in size).

2. `Full database <https://github.com/pathwayforte/results/blob/master/notebooks/evaluation/full_database>`_.
Comparison of functional enrichment tasks using the full databases. This exercise illustrates the
differences at database level.

3. `Comparisons of P-Value Distributions of Pathway Analogs <https://github.com/pathwayforte/results/blob/master/notebooks/evaluation/Comparisons%20of%20P-Value%20Distributions%20of%20Pathway%20Analogs.ipynb>`_.
Statistical analysis of the *p*-value distributions of the pathway analogues for all three enrichment tasks.
